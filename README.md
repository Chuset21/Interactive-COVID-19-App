# Interactive COVID-19 App  

A group project made with the help of 3 college colleagues in Processing, a Java based language which provides a free graphical library.  
**Goal of project**: Building an interactive visualization of a dataset of COVID-19 cases by geographic area.  

## Installing dependencies  

[This link](http://staff.city.ac.uk/~jwo/giCentre/geomap/geoMap.zip) should install the necessary files to set up this library for using .shp files  

Unzip these files into this directory: ***Documents -> Processing -> libraries*** (Or wherever the library folder inside your sketchbook is, your sketchbook can be found by opening processing and clicking File -> preferences -> and at the top is your sketchbook location).
